ETHERNET SHIELD
	http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet

	IP  address: 192.168.1.26
		IPAddress ip(192, 168, 1, 26);
	MAC address: 00:1D:FE:EA:39:17
		byte mac[] = { 0x00, 0x1D, 0xFE, 0xEA, 0x39, 0x19 };

	TESTING
		tested with code from http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ChatServer
		replaced IP and MAC addresses with appropriate values above
		uploaded the program

		telnet'ed in to snowduino
		>> telnet
		>> open 192.168.1.26
		>> whatever nonsense that I want to say
		>> ...
		>> Ctrl+] Enter //to exit

		telnet'ing back into snowduino has a problem
		each letter i type is doubled and newlines replace with ^M
		this all occurs on my command line, nothing is printed
		I believe this is because it's not a telnet server, which is another piece of sample code available

	CONTROL LED VIA WEB PAGE
		http://startingelectronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial/web-server-LED-control/

		pasted code into a sketch, replaced the IP and MAC addresses and it worked
		I happened to have an LED attached to pin 2, as they did in this example

		I'm having trouble on the webpage reading the state of the button and updating the page properly.

		I found out that pin 1 is not to be used if the line Serial.begin(9600); appears in the code.  Apparently it is to be used for diagnostics?
		moving the button to pin 5 made everything work how I expected!

		refreshing breaks the system and i have to restart it.  Probably just the code expects 


CODING
	const int redLedPin = 2;  //use consts to manage pin #s as variables
	const int buttonPin = 1;  
	boolean buttonState = 0;  //use variables that change as well.  INT?
	digitalWrite(redLedPin, HIGH); // turn on the red LED
	buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); //read the value of pin 1
	if (buttonState == HIGH){ doStuff(); } //do something about the button
	delay(1000); // wait 1 second
	* serial.begin(9600) makes pin 1 unusable by other stuff
	variables are in scope inside of methods
