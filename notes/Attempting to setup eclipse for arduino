Attempting to setup eclipse for arduino

downloaded eclipse luna
installed the avr plugin
  opened eclipse and went to help->install new software
  pasted the link from the avr plugin website into the "Work with" box
  selected the checkbox for the avr plugin and hit next a couple times

>> sudo apt-get install avrdude binutils-avr gcc-avr avr-libc gdb-avr

getting the core.a file

  >> arduino
  file->examples->basics->blink
  compile (checkmark button)

  cp /tmp/build[tab]/core.a .
  mv core.a libArduinoUnoCore.a

open eclipse
new c++ project
select avr cross compile application
type in the name
next
MCU Type: ATmega328P
MCU Frequency(Hz): 16000000

Project->Properties->c/c++ build -> settings -> additional tools in toolchain
   generate HEX file for flash memory (checked)
  print size (checked)
  AVRDude (checked) 

Project->Properties->c/c++ build -> settings -> avr compiler -> directories
  new path
  wherever you put the libArduinoUnoCore.a earlier

I may need to return to this, as it sounds like it should be .h files 

directions concerning other options
note typo on instructions says 
  Select AVR Compiler -> Language Standard 
instead of
  Select AVR C++ Compiler -> Language Standard


  "Select AVR C/C++ Linker
If you're using C++ then the hex file can get really big. In the linker menu, change the command to avr-gcc and the command line pattern to the following:
${COMMAND} --cref -s -Os ${OUTPUT_FLAG}${OUTPUT_PREFIX}${OUTPUT} ${INPUTS} -lm ${FLAGS}
Try without this change first."

I will return to this if I run into problems



      "Create symbol table
      Optional. Shows all objects (functions, variables, etc) in the program, sorted by address. In Settings -> AVR C++ Linker, under "expert settings", append (do not replace - append!)
      ; avr-nm -C -n ${OUTPUT} >${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.symbol"

      I will return to this if I don't have problems
